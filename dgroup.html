<h2>Background On DGROUP</h2>
<p>
  (Portions of this section are taken, with the kind permission of
  Dark Black Software, from the MrDebug Norton Guide)
</p>
<p>
  DGROUP is a 64K chunk of memory that, for a Clipper program, can be
  broken down into five distinct sections, each serving a specific
  purpose. DGROUP can be easily described as a 64K block of memory that is
  used by Clipper as a common area of memory that Cliper and third party
  products can rely on to find various items of information. There are
  five main parts to DGROUP:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <a id="MemVarTable"></a>The MemVar table (Dynamic)
    <p>
      This is used to store Clipper STATIC variables and ITEMs (declared
      through the ITEM API) with their contents if the contents and
      variable/ITEM definition can be held within 14 bytes, otherwise the
      variable/ITEM definition is held along with a pointer to a Virtual
      Memory segment where the variable/ITEM contents are held.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>DS Available (Dynamic)
    <p>
      This is the amount of free memory available within the DGROUP. This
      amount can be seen from //INFO as DS AVAIL or from the Memory/Info
      window. This will be reduced during the execution of the program as
      the Eval Stack and the Memvar table may both 'grow' into this area.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>Eval Stack (Dynamic)
    <p>
      This is where Clipper LOCAL variables are held (if the variable
      definition and contents take up 14 bytes or less), otherwise a pointer
      is stored to a Virtual memory segment that contains the variable
      contents.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>CPU Stack (Fixed)
    <p>
      The CPU stack is used to store the function return addresses each time a
      new function is called, as well as local 'C' variables.
    </p>
    <p>
      The size of the CPU stack is set when you link your program. It
      depends upon the linker that you are using and linker specific
      commands that you have in the link script that might increase or
      reduce the stack
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><a id="FixedCAndASM"></a>Fixed C and ASM Data (Fixed)
    <p>
      This area is used by other third party libraries and other languages
      that do not use their own data segments and use the default data
      segment (otherwise known to us Clipperites as DGROUP) to store fixed
      pieces of text and global variables used by other languages
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, inside Clipper, the un-recoverable error messages are
      stored within this section of the default data segment (DGROUP).
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  As you can see from the above, the DGROUP area is pretty important to the
  smooth running of your Clipper application, and a lack of DGROUP can cause
  your software to fall over with a number of internal errors.
</p>
<p>
  In an effort to make sure this does not happen you should try to reduce
  the impact your code has on DGROUP. Many 3rd party libraries use large
  ammounts of DGROUP (in my experience they can bump up the <a
  href="#FixedCAndASM">fixed C and ASM data</a> usage by quite a bit. If you
  need to use a number of 3rd party libraries this can become quite a
  problem.
</p>
<p>
  However, given that your chances of changing the usage of 3rd party
  libraries are pretty slim, the only chance you have of making a difference
  is by improving your own code to reduce its DGROUP usage.
</p>

<h2>What Can Be Done?</h2>
<p>
  If you write nothing but pure Clipper code, you still have the
  ability to reduce your DGROUP usage. The main area you can
  address is your use of STATIC variables. STATIC variables are,
  without a doubt, a good thing, but, they come with a price.
</p>
<p>
  Unlike the other variable types, each STATIC variable requires a fixed (14
  byte) entry in the <a href="#MemVarTable">the MemVar table</a>. On the
  surface this may not seem like a big deal. A STATIC only needs 14 bytes in
  DGROUP, what does it matter? To see how this matters, let's take the
  GETSYS.PRG code you can find in the SOURCE\SYS directory of your copy of
  Clipper as an example.
</p>
<p>
  Close to the top of the source you will find the following code:
</p>
<pre><code><strong>  //
  // State variables for active READ
  //</strong>
  STATIC sbFormat
  STATIC slUpdated := .F.
  STATIC slKillRead
  STATIC slBumpTop
  STATIC slBumpBot
  STATIC snLastExitState
  STATIC snLastPos
  STATIC soActiveGet
  STATIC scReadProcName
  STATIC snReadProcLine
</code></pre>
<p>
  As you can see, there are 10 STATIC variables, each using 14
  bytes in the <a href="#MemVarTable">MemVar Table</a>. With
  a simple little trick we can reduce that 140 bytes of usage
  down to 14 bytes. Watch:
</p>
<pre><code><strong>  // Hold all the statics in one static.</strong>

  Static _aSysStuff := { NIL, .F., NIL, NIL, NIL, NIL,;
                         NIL, NIL, NIL, NIL }

  <strong>// Translated static variable names.</strong>

  #xtranslate sbFormat        =&gt; _aSysStuff\[ 01 \]
  #xtranslate slUpdated       =&gt; _aSysStuff\[ 02 \]
  #xtranslate slKillRead      =&gt; _aSysStuff\[ 03 \]
  #xtranslate slBumpTop       =&gt; _aSysStuff\[ 04 \]
  #xtranslate slBumpBot       =&gt; _aSysStuff\[ 05 \]
  #xtranslate snLastExitState =&gt; _aSysStuff\[ 06 \]
  #xtranslate snLastPos       =&gt; _aSysStuff\[ 07 \]
  #xtranslate soActiveGet     =&gt; _aSysStuff\[ 08 \]
  #xtranslate scReadProcName  =&gt; _aSysStuff\[ 09 \]
  #xtranslate snReadProcLine  =&gt; _aSysStuff\[ 10 \]
</code></pre>
<p>
  With that simple little trick you will have reduced the DGROUP usage from
  140 bytes to just 14 bytes.
</p>
<p>
  If you have lots of code of your own that has a large number of file wide
  STATICs in a single file you can make quite a difference.
</p>
<p>
  If you write your own C functions, then it's a wise move to take a look at
  the compiler options at your disposal, as some of these can drastically
  reduce the impact on DGROUP.
</p>
<p>
  For example, take the following piece of code:
</p>
<pre><code>  #include &lt;extend.api&gt;

  CLIPPER YesNo( void )              <strong>// Return yes or no string</strong>
  {
      if ( _parl(1) )                <strong>// .T. passed to function?</strong>
      {
          _retc( "Yes" );            <strong>// Yes, so return "Yes"</strong>
      }
      else
      {
          _retc( "No" );             <strong>// No, so return "No"</strong>
      }
  }
</code></pre>
<p>
  Simple enough, but already we've just used 7 (or 8) bytes of DGROUP
  without thinking! Why? you ask. Answer: It's the strings. By default, C
  compilers will put constants (which means strings, doubles, floats and
  some arrays) into DGROUP. And when I say '7 (or 8)', it's because some
  compilers will align data on a WORD boundary as default, and you can
  usually expect the DGROUP usage to be a tad more than you thought.
</p>
<p>
  You can change this by looking for a compiler option to reverse this
  default. For example, with the Microsoft C compilers, there is the /Gt
  switch and for Borland C compilers there is the -Ff switch. Given a number
  of 1, it will automatically put any constants larger than 1 length into a
  FAR segment, and out of DGROUP! This means, that no matter how much data
  is used by your C functions for strings and things, it won't make a
  difference to DGROUP.
</p>
<p>
  With assembler code, we use the same principles. Don't use _DATA, _BSS,
  CONST or DGROUP for data storage if you can possibly help it.
</p>
<p>
  So, if you have a module like this:
</p>
<pre><code>    _DATA           SEGMENT WORD PUBLIC 'DATA'
            cYes    DB      'Yes', 0
            cNo     DB      'No', 0
    _DATA           ENDS

    DGROUP  GROUP   _DATA

    YESNO_TEXT      SEGMENT WORD PUBLIC 'CODE'

            ASSUME cs:YESNO_TEXT, ds:DGROUP

    YESNO           PROC    FAR
                    PUSH    bp
                    MOV     bp, sp

                    MOV     ax, 1
                    PUSH    ax
                    CALL    __parl
                    ADD     sp, 2

                    OR      ax, ax
                    JZ      ZeroSoItsFalse

                    MOV     ax, OFFSET cYes
                    JMP     SHORT ReturnString

    ZeroSoItsFalse: MOV     ax, OFFSET cNo

    ReturnString:
                    PUSH    ax
                    PUSH    ds
                    CALL    __retc
                    ADD     sp, 4

                    POP     bp
                    RETF
    YESNO           ENDP

    YESNO_TEXT      ENDS
                    END
</code></pre>
<p>
  You've again used 7 (or 8) bytes of DGROUP without thinking, so in this
  case you would have to alter the segments and anything that used the data
  in them so that DGROUP can once again be saved:
</p>
<pre><code>    <strong>YESNO_DATA</strong>      SEGMENT WORD PUBLIC <strong>'FAR_DATA'</strong>
            cYes    DB      'Yes', 0
            cNo     DB      'No', 0
    <strong>YESNO_DATA</strong>      ENDS

    YESNO_TEXT      SEGMENT WORD PUBLIC 'CODE'
            ASSUME cs:YESNO_TEXT, ds:NOTHING

    YESNO           PROC    FAR
                    PUSH    bp
                    MOV     bp, sp

                    MOV     ax, 1
                    PUSH    ax
                    CALL    __parl
                    ADD     sp, 2

                    OR      ax, ax
                    JZ      ZeroSoItsFalse

                    MOV     ax, OFFSET cYes
                    JMP     SHORT ReturnString

    ZeroSoItsFalse: MOV     ax, OFFSET cNo

    ReturnString:   PUSH    ax
                    <strong>PUSH    YESNO_DATA</strong>
                    CALL    __retc
                    ADD     sp, 4

                    POP     bp
                    RETF
    YESNO           ENDP

    YESNO_TEXT      ENDS
                    END
</code></pre>
<p>
  As you can see, if your application is tight on DGROUP, with the
  source to hand and a little bit of work you can free up some of
  that usage. Let's just hope you have the source code for the worst
  offending code in your application.

<h2>Using DGSCAN To Find DGROUP Usage</h2>
<p>
  Back when I first became aware of this "problem" I started to work on my
  own library code and managed to reduce some of the DGROUP usage. However,
  working through all that code was getting to be pretty boring. That's when
  I decided to write DGSCAN. What I wanted was a tool that could scan OBJ
  and LIB files and find anything that might be taking up precious DGROUP
  space.
</p>
<p>
  If you want to get and try out DGSCAN then download the <a
  href="../dgscn300.zip">ZIP file</a> and unzip it. Done? Good.
</p>
<p>
  Ok, let's take a simple example of using DGSCAN. Look at the following
  code:
</p>
<pre><code>  Static xVar1
  Static xVar2
  Static xVar3
  Static xVar4

  Function Main()

     ? "I'm eating up DGROUP"

  Return( NIL )
</code></pre>
<p>
  Compile it into an OBJ and then run DGSCAN over it:
</p>
<pre><code>  F:\DGTEST&gt;dgscan <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3092.txt">foo</a>.obj

  DgScan v3.00 - DGROUP Usage Scanner
  By Dave Pearson

  File-------- Module--------------------------- Segment----------- Bytes-----
  FOO.OBJ      FOO                               STATICS$                   56
  FOO.OBJ      *** Total ***                                                56
</code></pre>
<p>
  As you can see, DGSCAN has detected 56 bytes of possible DGROUP usage.
  This is because we have 4 STATIC variables, each with a 14 byte
  impact. If you applied the "array trick" we spoke about
  earlier you would see the usage reduced to 14 bytes.
</p>
<p>
  To generate a report for all your OBJ files just do:
</p>
<pre><code>  F:\DGTEST&gt;dgscan *.obj</code></pre>
<p>
  It's as simple as that, and the same goes for LIB files.
</p>
<p>
  I won't say much more about DGSCAN, everything you need to know is
  covered by the file DGSCAN.TXT found in the DGSCAN archive. However,
  if you do have problems with the utility please feel free to
  <a href="mailto:davep&#64;davep.org">mail me</a> and I'll
  try to help you out.
